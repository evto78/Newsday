  bodyText: "Tech enthusiasts in the Heartland area have reported a bizarre phenomenon
    where digital displays, including projectors and high-end gaming monitors, are
    experiencing \"frame-hiccups\" at exactly 3:00 AM. <b><link=\u201DD31\u201D>Experts
    suggest it may be related to a local BIOS update gone wrong or a massive surge
    in the regional power grid. </link></b>\r\n\"I was just trying to deposit some
    money\" said one local resident. \"Suddenly, the screen stuttered, my mouse started
    double-clicking on its own, and my RGB lighting turned dark and 'underground'.
    It was cool, but I couldn't finish my work.\"\r\n<b><link=\u201DD32\u201D>The
    local service board suggests that anyone experiencing these issues should check
    their motherboard firmware or ensure their \"Wireless Display\" features are
    correctly installed. </link></b>\"It\u2019s likely just a glitch in the simulation,\"
    a spokesperson added."
