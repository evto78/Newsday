  bodyText: "The Tenno Relay Council is in a state of panic this morning after the
    Platinum-to-Credits exchange rate plummeted by 40%. The crash was triggered by
    an anonymous trader who flooded the market with thousands of \"Condition Overload\"
    mods, claiming they found a \"farming exploit\" involving a specific room in
    the Orokin Derelict that hasn't been patched in years.\r\n<link=\u201DD41\u201D>
    \"The economy is in shambles,\" says a prominent Maroo's Bazaar merchant. \"I
    traded a Prime Set for three Ducats and a handful of Nano Spores yesterday. If
    the Lotus doesn't step in and regulate the drop rates, we\u2019re going to be
    back to bartering with raw Rubedo by next week.\"</link>\r\nSecurity at the relays
    has been tightened to prevent \"pump and dump\" schemes, but rumors persist that
    a secret syndicate is hoarding all the <link=\"D42>Void Relics to create an artificial
    shortage before the next Prime Access launch.</link>\r\n"
