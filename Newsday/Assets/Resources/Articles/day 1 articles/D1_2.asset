  bodyText: "Big Coffee \u2013 corporate giants such as BarStucks, Him Tortons, DcMonalds,
    Cesnaf\xE9 and Bunkin Bonuts report that coffee production has increased after
    trade restrictions have eased between NCR and The Brotherhood. \r\nOne representative
    from BarStucks claims that they will have the biggest drop in their coffee price,
    but are projected to retain profits, if not increase them. \r\nDcMonalds, Him
    Tortons, Cesnafe are following the same, dropping coffee prices.\r\nControversially,
    Bunkin Bonuts are keeping their coffee prices the same, claiming that their coffee
    is as cheap as it gets. A representative from Bunkin says \u201CWe are as cheap
    as it gets, but we still provide the best quality in our coffee.\u201D\r\n"
