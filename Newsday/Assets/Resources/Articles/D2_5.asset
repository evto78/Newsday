  bodyText: "Alterra Corporation has issued a mandatory stay-away order for the Crater\u2019s
    edge following the interception of a rhythmic, low-frequency signal. Long-range
    scanners originally flagged the sound as a Reaper Leviathan migration,<link=\"D51>
    but further analysis revealed that it is just how deeper fish communicate.</link>\r\n\"It
    shouldn't be possible,\" said one lead xenobiologist. \"There is no power source
    out there, yet the signal is coming from 500 meters down. It sounds like someone
    left a waterproof speaker in the Void.\"\r\nWhile some divers believe it\u2019s
    a precursor artifact, local conspiracy theorists on the Aurora suggest it\u2019s
    a rogue \"Ghost Leviathan\" that has somehow evolved to mimic the sound of 21st-century
    underground rap. Alterra has reminded all employees that investigating the signal
    is a fireable offense and will result in the immediate forfeiture of their end-of-year
    credits.\r\n"
