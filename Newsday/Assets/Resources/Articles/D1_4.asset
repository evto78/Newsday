  bodyText: "Michael De Santa, an Investor who invested in Pfister and Pegassi, who
    are both now out with their second line of Electric cars, after their first lines
    failed.\r\n\u201CYou can already see the increase in air quality in South Los
    Santos after the first shipments of cars were sent to the city!\u201D Says Michael
    D. Santa.\r\nA scientist from the Environment board of Los Santos, staying anonymous,
    says that the production energy requirements have gone down, but the cars still
    use a lot of energy to charge the cars, which might not necessarily mean better,
    even though it is better than before.\u201D\r\nMichael De Santa responds to this
    on his new Switter post \u2013 \u201CThey clearly don\u2019t know what they\u2019re
    talking about! I have personally seen the cars myself; I KNOW that they are good
    for the environment! F**k you, who gives a f**k about the board anyway? Everyone
    knows that they are paid off by Pfister! Those rats are always out to get us!\u201D\r\nA
    representative from Pfister claims that they have done no such thing, and that
    these are false claims from D. Santa.\r\n"
