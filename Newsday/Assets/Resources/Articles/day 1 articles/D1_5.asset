  bodyText: "\u201CWe have dealt with the protestors who did ruin the piece, and
    we are deeply heartbroken that such a historic piece has been ruined.\u201D says
    the spokesperson for the Gallery.\r\nThe gallery is now re-opened, with all art
    pieces, except for the Lona Misa. \r\nIn an interview, Gan Vogh\u2019s grandson,
    when asked what is going to happen to the Lona Misa, says that \u201CWe are going
    to take back the painting and keep it (the painting) and salvage what can be
    salvaged from it. I don\u2019t want to let go of the history in my family.\u201D\r\nArt
    Critics and fans on Switter are vocal about this. One Switter user voices their
    opinion on this \u201CAs good as the Lisa Mona is, it is the best way to send
    a message. Not something I necessarily agree with, but now the whole world is
    talking about the protestors, which means they got what they wanted \u2013 bringing
    attention to the oil crisis.\u201D\r\n"
