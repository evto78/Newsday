  bodyText: "Fire tore through a home in Arasaka district midday on Monday.\r\n\u201CI
    was taking a nap, and I heard sirens outside and some commotion, and then I smelt
    the smoke and ran out, to see ****\u2019s house on fire.\u201D\r\n4 out of 5
    residents of the house are safe. The 5th resident has experienced some minor
    burns, but was treated quickly, thanks to the quick response from the fire crew.
    \r\n\u201CWe are thankful to the firecrew that was able to save most of our belongings,
    and we are grateful to be part of the Trauma Team International\u2019s Platinum
    Executive plan and their quick response time\u201D\r\nTrauma team confirmed that
    they were quick to the response as soon as they noticed the spike in their client\u2019s
    heart rate, and the response time was exactly 2 minutes 54 seconds.\r\n\u201CMan,
    you ain\u2019t know how bad I was panicking when I saw my crib lit up man. Hopefully
    It wasn\u2019t because of the deodorant I spilled on my heater man, that woulda
    been stupid!\u201D A high school student from the resident\u2019s family claims.\r\n\r\n"
