  bodyText: "Vegas residents are waking up to empty vending machines this week as
    Nuka-Cola Corporation confirms a massive supply chain disruption. The signature
    glowing blue soda, known for its high caffeine and isotope content, has become
    a rare commodity following a raid on a shipping caravan near Primm.\r\n\"I haven't
    slept in three days, and my glow is starting to fade,\" said one local prospector
    outside the Tops Casino. \"If I don't get my Quantum fix soon, I might have to
    switch to Sunset Sarsaparilla, and we all know that stuff is just root beer for
    cowards.\"\r\n<b><link=\u201DD21\u201D> A corporate representative blamed \"local
    raider interference\" and \"logistical nightmares regarding the handling of radioactive
    materials,\" but promised that a fresh shipment is currently under heavy guard
    and should arrive by the end of the month. </link>   </b>Prices on the secondary
    \"Cap-Market\" have already tripled.\r\n"
