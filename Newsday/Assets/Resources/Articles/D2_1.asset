    divoy excavation is now operational. The project, that faced several delays <link=\u201DD11\u201D>due
    to meteoric activity and mysterious purple energy spikes, was finished 3 weeks
    early thanks to \u201Cenhanced labor protocols\u201D </link>\r\n\u201Cwe wanted
    to ensure that researches have a roof over their heads before the next storm
    cycle hits\u201D, said a vindertech site lead.\r\nRetail Row residents have expressed
    concerns about noise levels and water pollution. One resident, who wished to
    remain anonymous, stated: \u201CIt\u2019s not just the construction noise, but
    later at night you can hear this low humming sound coming from the pit. <link=\u201DD12\u201D>
    My TV keeps glitching to a llama-shaped test pattern. I just wanna sleep.\u201D
